DSH Desktop packages the local Web UI, Host service, and plugin system from [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) into a native desktop application. Official Harness runs unchanged at a pinned version; Desktop provides the window, tray, terminal, updates, and work profiles through the official plugin composition.

## Download and install

Current release installers support Windows x64 and macOS Universal. No extra environment is needed — download, install, and start using it with one click.

| Platform | Download | Installation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | [Download installer](https://www.dshdesktop.cn/api/downloads/windows) | Run the NSIS installer and follow its prompts |
| macOS Universal | [Download DMG](https://www.dshdesktop.cn/api/downloads/mac) | Open the DMG and drag DSH Desktop into Applications |

See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.en.md) and [FAQ](docs/faq.en.md) for plugin commands, platform details, and troubleshooting.

Together with every plugin author, we want to build an open, composable, and sustainable DSH plugin ecosystem where plugins grow alongside each other. Read the [DSH plugin ecosystem manifesto](docs/plugin-ecosystem.en.md).

## Documentation

Ordinary users can start with the [user guide](docs/user-guide.en.md); the developer documentation is only needed when extending or maintaining the application.

## Plugin Ecosystem

Plugins are extensions that add capabilities to DSH — models, tools, interfaces, and workflows can all be plugins, combined like building blocks.

DSH Desktop does not fork or modify upstream source, and it is not a fixed, hardcoded shell. Official DeepSeek Harness runs unchanged at a pinned version; the desktop shell itself — the window, tray, terminal, updates, and work profiles — is a legitimate DSH plugin, composed into the same runtime through the official plugin mechanism. From the core agent to the desktop shell, the whole product follows the same "everything is a plugin" rule: plugins from the official ecosystem work directly, and desktop capabilities are combined, replaced, and evolve the same way.

We want the plugin ecosystem to work like a phone app store: every plugin is built against the same set of rules, so plugins can be installed together and work together without interfering with each other.

### For developers

Unlike many other projects, this project itself is a DSH [plugin](docs/plugin-development.en.md): the desktop shell composes through the same official path as third-party plugins. Desktop plugin capabilities are now available. We provide Desktop services so plugin developers can integrate their plugins with desktop capabilities: for example, viewing and switching work profiles, or installing, updating, and removing plugins in the active profile. See the [Desktop plugin API](dsh-plugin-desktop/docs/plugin-services.md) for complete usage details. See [Why DSH Desktop](docs/why-desktop.en.md) and [Plugin development](docs/plugin-development.en.md) for the reasoning and the third-party boundary.

## Relationship to the Official Project

This project is built on [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

This project is an implementation built on DeepSeek Harness and the Cordis plugin model, intended to provide the foundation for the DSH desktop experience.

The official project provides the core agent capabilities, plugin system, and Web UI. This project primarily provides:

- Desktop application packaging
- Starting, stopping, and recovering the local service
- Desktop window and system tray integration
- macOS and Windows installer builds and releases
- An interface designed for desktop use

If you prefer to run Harness from the command line or contribute to its core functionality, refer to the official repository first.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to the [original DeepSeek Harness repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) and the DeepSeek AI team. DSH Desktop is built from a pinned upstream checkout, and its core agents, models, tools, sessions, Web UI, and plugin ecosystem come from that project.

We also thank [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis) for the plugin foundation that makes this composition possible. DSH Desktop would not exist without these open-source projects.

We are also grateful to the [Koishi.js](https://koishi.chat/) project and community for their long-standing work on plugin practices, tooling, and shared knowledge, and to everyone who contributes discussions, testing, feedback, and plugins.

Also, and you.

## Development

Desktop source lives in `dsh-plugin-desktop/`. The outer repository uses Yarn, while the pinned `deepseek-harness/` submodule keeps its own pnpm workspace. From the repository root:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
corepack yarn install --immutable
corepack yarn dev
```

Use `corepack yarn check` for the headless gate. The [architecture](docs/architecture.en.md) and package [`README`](dsh-plugin-desktop/README.md) describe the full build, test, and release boundaries. See [CONTRIBUTING.en.md](CONTRIBUTING.en.md) for how to contribute.
